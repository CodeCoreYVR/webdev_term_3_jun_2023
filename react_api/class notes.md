* React is open source javascript library build by facebook to make UI development.
https://github.com/facebook/react

* React api uses a virtual dom on top of dom api. It is more manageable and makes the UI development faster and more efficient.
There are other js library that uses virtual dom to render UI more efficiently. It is usable with many module and packeages of npm.

* It creates component that can be reused. We change a single component and the effect is reflected everyong.

* It comes with the idea of reactive programming (specifying the dynamic behavior of a value based on its declaration). React uses state and hooks for this thing.

* A person recently developed a virtual dom that is faster than react: https://dev.to/aidenybai/i-made-react-with-a-faster-virtual-dom-37hd

* React uses React.createElment where dom api uses document.createElement. 

* JSX is used as syntax sugar to make it developer friendly. Babel converts jsx to js
